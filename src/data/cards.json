After meeting several other idols at a certain event, she began thinking about the driving motivation from her early days: \"enjoying every moment.\" This led her to question what it really means to be the greatest pop star, and she realized that the answer lies beyond talent and theory, in the relationship and feeling of togetherness with one's fans.<br/><color=#f45d68>[Event] Spirit Idol Competition</color>",

Witnessing Pazuzu's horror firsthand, some people even tried to use her in the fight against other evil spirits by drawing her image on protective charms. Delighted at the portrayal of her likeness, Pazuzu befriended the humans, and set about destroying the evil that was besieging them. After an incident while exorcising evil spirits, Pazuzu herself became a spirit and built a relationship with the Bureau of the Occult. Controlling hot winds, Pazuzu works to guarantee the perfect conditions for a spirit-world firework festival. With her around, the event is sure to go off with a bang.

Did something go wrong again...?\"</color><br/><color=#ef9843>The spirit of one of Sanzang's companions in Journey to the West.</color> He's better known to most people as Sha Wujing, but in Heaven he goes by his official title as a general. Always the analytical type, he tends to forget his surroundings in his internal quest to reach a logical conclusion. He's also extremely honest about things and can be a little awkward, but it's also refreshing to watch him stubbornly push forward with his logic. He may not talk much, but when he does, he gets to the point and makes sure not to do anything that would injure his pride. Needless to say, his personal values often clash with his companions' more carefree approach to life.",

However, because of Shiva's penchant to vanish from sight whenever there is a concert coming, he has been deeply perplexed. As Shiva yields great power, it isn't really her safety that he is concerned with; he is more worried that others would get on her nerves unknowingly and enrage her. So in reality, his job is to stay on top of things before Shiva loses her temper and get the situation sorted out as quickly as possible.

In this vast universe, if one wishes to be saved from the misfortune of losing his bearings, he can never afford to slack off.<br/><color=#f45d68>[Event] Guild Conquest</color>",

She rejects all acts of bias, prejudice and violence and if one were to slap her on the right cheek, she would present her left cheek to the aggressor without hesitation; such is the extent of her conviction for non-violence. However, due to her nagging nature and her extremely naive way of thinking, very few actually understand her. While she often acts as the \"buffer of reason\" for her aggressive sister the Red Queen, apparently the two has never been able to see eye to eye according to the Chancellor.

Coupled with her habit of lecturing others and refuting ideas proposed by others, one has to make relevant mental preparations before engaging in conversation with her. On top of that, as she claims to be a gourmet, she is way more picky and selective about food. With the exception of her preferred way of eating, she will deny all other methods of preparation. This makes her a pain to deal with.

But he is extremely bad at dealing with females and even more so when the person in question is good looking; he won't be able to even look at her straight in the eyes. He is actually rather shy. As of late, he is worried about the fact that his childhood friend Virgo is becoming more and more adorable by the day and he doesn't know how he should act or behave around her...<br/><color=#f45d68>[Event] Guild Conquest</color>",

She never likes to speak much. Even when she must speak, only a minimum number of words can be heard from her. Rather than possessing monstrous strength, she is great at reading actions that the others will take. It is a rare talent among the demons for a knowledgeable commander who can lead an army and exercise its power. In a clan full of powerful demons that approves only physical strength, she could take the seat as one of the four heavenly kings with only her wits. Her outstanding capability can only be imagined. She and Ibaraki share a common interest. For this reason, they spend quite a lot of time together. Rumors say that they are lovers, but she cuts it clear with \"I am not interested in playboy...\" The truth is still unclear...<br/><color=#f45d68>[Event] Galaxy Express and the mysterious signal</color>",

But if you were to make the mistake of thinking that beauty is the only weapon she has in her arsenal, you will be sorely mistaken. The reason for this is simple: her true weapon lies in her rhetoric known as \"temptation;\" the first time one talks to her, he would develop a liking for her. The second conversation with her, the victim would grow fonder of her, and it only takes one more conversation for him to become her slave.  Her beauty is nothing more than a superficial edge she has; in order to survive and succeed in the royal court that is rampant with scheming and plotting, her ways of the world have turned out to be her greatest strength.  Even so, the fact that she has more room for development and growth makes her a formidable enemy……Her only weakness is her distaste for reptiles. She has a special hatred for snakes. She is intricately involved in a complicated relationship with Julius and Brutus……",

She is very homely by nature and is willing to give everything for the sake of family. As soon as one makes the request, she would receive the guest with food she has personally prepared. The strange thing is, the dining table would be covered with dishes and no one has any idea when she has cooked all that food. That said, most spirits only care about being able to taste her delicious dishes and seldom spare a second thought to such triviality. And thus, they'd simply overlook the bizarre circumstance.

Any dish that needs to be prepared in a pot or cauldron, be it soup or noodles of any kind, she will be able to re-create it, regardless of how old/new/exotic the recipe is. She is most well-known for re-creating the ultimate ramen - the signature dish of \"Tientien Ken\" that was once thought to be gone from the world when the recipe was lost. The story is so wide spread that no one in the circle of spirit culinary hasn't heard her name. However, if you praise her too much, she would forget herself and become very cocky. When this happens, you'd have to eat exactly the way she demands you to. When it's a stubborn old geezer that does this to you, you will probably get upset; but she has the look of an innocent little girl, so some may actually consider this as an added bonus in a twisted sense...<br/><color=#f45d68>[Event] The Definitive Eating Competition for Spirits!</color>",

Not only that, she is also incredibly gifted in her rhetoric, so much so that even Shogun Yoshimune didn't stand a chance against her in a duel of words.

Her power and strength will vary depending on the source of energy she taps from.

As she was created as a machine, she is skilled at computation and seems to have the ability to quantify all events for analysis.

But after witnessing the way she leads her disorganized and unruly personal life, he was consumed with a burning desire and a sense of mission to help Cassiopeia. He had wanted to ask Cassiopeia to instruct him in the skills of sword play and military tactics, but he quickly realized that the only things he had gotten better at were domestic tasks such as cooking, doing laundry and so forth.

As he is fiercely loyal and upholds friendship, he is admired and respected by his subordinates and perceived as the ideal commander to follow. He also has had a bit of history with Guan Yu.

And as such, she has been perceived as an existence that can never be conquered.  Although she can't speak, she would get angry when anyone is foolish enough to badmouth her. This also means she seems to be able to understand the language of human beings. With no hope of ever defeating her, mankind felt that at the very least, attempts should be made to communicate with her so that a consensus on coexistence can be struck with her. Thus far, numerous brave souls have tried talking to her but none has succeeded to date.  There has only ever been one man - the young warrior Perseus, who allegedly has had an encounter with her that can be said as a conversation. But no one can attest to the truth of such rumor.<br/><color=#f45d68>[Event] Guild Conquest</color>",

Because of his personality and antics, he is on very poor terms with other members of the Clavicles of the King. Despite the incredibly tense situation he shares with other compatriots, due to his ability of forcing any tool kami he got into his servitude as a weapon, even the other powerful members of the Clavicles of the King wouldn't dare to challenge him. Such is the delicate status of balance between him and others.

Not only that, his movements have also become as smooth and seamless as the flow of water; he can easily parry any attacks made against him and unless one has attained the state of seeing with his/her mind's eye, his/her attack wouldn't even be able to find its target. Nevertheless, his infusion also exacerbated his illness and now he can only fight at his full power for no longer than 3 minutes.  But even so, it is said that there are less than five individuals in this world who can last for longer than a minute in a fight against him... Still, he is training just as diligently as ever on a daily basis, and perhaps that's what makes him \"a genius at diligent training\".<br/><color=#f45d68>[Event] Clavicle of the King</color>",

Born with the most powerful spirit essence ever gifted to heirs of the Tsuchimikado Clan, she led a secluded life from the mortal world and grew up with spirits and demons instead. As a result, she has grown to see spirits and demons as equals to mankind.  Because of this, she secretly developed a method of manifestation that is unrestricted by karma and named her technique as \"Karmic Liberation\" - giving life to numerous spirits who could live in freedom. Her greatest wish is to create a world where humans, spirits and demons can live in peace, harmony and joy. Nevertheless, for spirit agents who use and order demons as tools and soldiers, her ideas are nothing short of radical and out of the box.

However, he was put into an extended slumber due to Minamoto no Yorimitsu's clever ambush. When he manifested in the modern days, his terrible grudge drove him to exact his revenge on mankind but was utterly humbled by Tsuchimikado Mikado as he finally tasted defeat.

This period of placid serenity helped him to find peace within his heart. Even though he can't find it in himself to show his true feelings in the presence of Mikado, he is extremely loyal to her and will even willingly give up his life for her sake.

As she led a life of a street performer who can barely put food on her table, she encountered Homer, who shares similar values and beliefs with her. The two have been partners ever since. It is said that their neighbors would hear the sounds of guitar duet from the run-down apartment they once dwelled from time to time and such stories have become legends...
