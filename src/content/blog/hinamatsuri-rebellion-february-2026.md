After all the auction madness, here's the breakdown on the new event cards.

---

## Pre-Event Gacha

:card[1584] is an XP and drop rate boosting healer now in the standard pool. I don't think she displaces :card[1321] in most content - her skill is worse, and Divina doesn't have that many damaging spells to boost. She's usable if you find yourself with 5 copies, but probably not worth orbing. **Skip.**

## Event Cards

:card[1526] *(Limited Gacha)* and :card[1529] *(Overall Ranking)* are the pair to watch. Together they give :card[1526] +60% crit rate, 65% crit damage (progressive), and 60% final wave damage. I don't know yet if this will crack into the world boss meta - it's possible but we may have to wait and see. In any case the combo is very good across all content. :card[1526] probably already dethrones :card[1401] as the highest single-round damage card, though :card[1401] doesn't have the conditional requiring two card slots. Note that only :card[1529] grants the bonus to :card[1526] - :card[228] does not apply. These two will be the main targets for most players this event. **High priority pair - the best thing this event has to offer.**

:card[1528] *(Ranking Reward - 1st & 2nd Half)* is a fairly strong support or reserve pick for Divina teams. Her skill isn't very impactful, but her passives are solid - 25% attack speed for all Divina allies and 35% final wave damage for Divina team members. **Good Divina support, weak skill.**

:card[1531] *(March Exchange)* is a small upgrade to :card[715], increasing the effect by 2%. That's not enough to make the card especially relevant, but it's probably usable in some team comps if it's easily accessible. **Niche - pick up if easy to get.**

:card[1527] *(Standard Gacha)* is a 4★ but punches well above its rarity - 44% Crit DMG to the 2 allies with the highest ATK is a lot for a 4★, comparable to :card[600]. A strong reserve option for newer players who don't have better crit damage supports yet. **Strong reserve for newer players - grab if accessible.**

:card[1539] *(Story Reward)* is an extremely tanky Anima melee. 40% damage reduction is more than most content requires, but if you run into any situation where you need a rock-solid tank, this is one of the best options available. When her HP drops to 10% or below, she gains a permanent 50% damage boost and heals 10% HP over 5 seconds - so the lower she gets, the harder she hits. **Strong niche pick for any content where survivability is the bottleneck.**

:card[1540] *(Limited Gacha)* is a 10% progressive crit rate alternative to :card[1494]. He's probably better in Endless or reserve, while :card[1494] still edges out in XP modes thanks to the XP boost. If you don't have :card[1494] at level 75, this is one to target. **Good Divina reserve option, especially for Endless.**

> **Data Note:** The skill description says it increases DMG dealt by all allies, but the current game data has an incorrect effect type behind the scenes. This will likely be fixed before the event goes live, so the skill should work as described.

:card[1590] *(Standard Gacha - post event)* is a decent defensive support that boosts damage for the top two Divina allies, while also providing major damage reduction on the final wave. She's comparable to :card[672] in reserve, but more defensive - :card[672] is the higher damage option for Divina reserve slots. **Solid Divina reserve for survivability-focused builds; :card[672] if you want more damage.**

## TL;DR

- :card[1526] (Limited Gacha) + :card[1529] (Overall Ranking) - **High priority pair** - top single-round Anima damage with the combo active, potential WB meta
- :card[1528] (Ranking - 1st & 2nd Half) - **Good Divina support** - solid passive, weak skill
- :card[1540] (Limited Gacha) - **Good Divina reserve** - better than :card[1494] in Endless
- :card[1539] (Story Reward) - **Strong Anima tank** - 40% DR if you need survivability
- :card[1590] (Standard Gacha - post event) - **Solid Divina reserve** - defensive support for WB and story/tower
- :card[1527] (Standard Gacha) - **Strong reserve for newer players** - 44% Crit DMG to top 2 ATK allies, comparable to :card[600]
- :card[1531] (March Exchange) - **Niche** - small upgrade to :card[715], grab if accessible
- :card[1584] (Standard Gacha) - **Skip** - XP/drop healer, doesn't displace :card[1321]

*A note on recommendations: Play how you like! If you want a card, go for it. My recommendations highlight cards I see as standouts - ones unlikely to be replaced for some time - while being mindful of cost. The game is fairly generous, so you can pick up cards that aren't super strong and still have resources for the next event. Don't hesitate to buy a card you like!*
