# Welcome to OtogiDB

OtogiDB is a comprehensive card database for **Otogi Spirit Agents**, featuring detailed stats, skills, and abilities for all cards in the game.

## Features

- **Complete Card Database**: Browse all 868+ cards with full stats
- **Search & Filter**: Find cards by name, skill, attribute, or type
- **Update History**: Track card changes across game versions
- **Mobile Friendly**: Works great on phones and tablets

## Using Card References

In blog posts, you can reference cards using the `:card[id]` syntax. For example:

- :card[100101] - Reference by ID
- :card[Nue] - Reference by name

These will show as links with hover popups showing card details.
