# Welcome to OtogiDB

OtogiDB is a comprehensive card database for **Otogi Spirit Agents**, featuring detailed stats, skills, and abilities for all cards in the game.

## Why OtogiDB?

Otogi Spirit Agents was re-released in 2024, and many online resources still contain outdated information from the original release. Card stats, skill descriptions, and game mechanics have changed significantly since then.

**OtogiDB provides accurate, up-to-date data** extracted directly from the current game client, ensuring you have reliable information for team building and strategy.

## Features

- **Complete Card Database**: Browse all 868+ cards with full stats
- **Search & Filter**: Find cards by name, skill, attribute, or type
- **Similar Cards**: Find replacement options based on attribute, type, and skill tags
- **Update History**: Track card changes across game versions
- **Mobile Friendly**: Works great on phones and tablets

## Using Card References

In blog posts, you can reference cards using the `:card[id]` syntax. For example:

- :card[1] - Reference by ID
- :card[Nue] - Reference by name

Hover over these links to see a preview of the card's stats and skills.
