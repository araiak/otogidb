I'll do a really quick one here, generally these cards have been power crept and that is a bit evident in the lower prices. There are 3 that could stand out so I'll throw out my thoughts on those here.

## Standout Cards

:card[383] is one of the top 5 Phantasma melee, and could be good for new players. At level 70, you get a decent reserve ability, and even her self buff for final wave only requires two copies. Her effective health is a bit low as she is attack heavy, so you need a good healer or to play a second more tanky melee. You get a side benefit you can move to reserve when you replace her, so she has some medium longevity in a new player's team as 30% crit damage to your two highest attack is not great, but it's not bad either.

A good replacement is :card[738] or :card[734], but those are probably still 3 months out in Auction and probably are moderately expensive. On the plus side :card[738] is probably keeping her nice and cheap since Cao Cao owners aren't likely to buy her. Stock is fairly low though. Is that worth money to you, I don't know, but she's not that expensive if you are willing to spend or have 2000 jewels from level ups and story rewards burning a hole in your pocket. This is a pretty good choice if you can't wait for the 3rd Anniversary auction in probably 3 months. (We should have Dolls in January, Demon Hunter in Feb, and 3rd in March if my memory serves me). **Good pickup for new Phantasma players who can't wait.**

:card[614] is a minor XP booster with the kicker of increasing the base stats of your attached card. This isn't as good as say :card[580] or :card[751], but if you are looking for a minor offensive boost to pair with a minor XP boost that's what this card is. At 4 copies for the minor offensive boost this card looks expensive even at 2000 jewels. **Pass for most players.**

:card[613] is a Phantasma progressive skill damage monster like: :list[1435,1312] Maybe she most resembles :card[1314] with a static instead of progressive crit rate boost and the bonus of a crit damage boost. This is one of the better progressive AoE cards, but I'm not sure those are very useful outside of Challenge, and :card[1307] kind of undermines the value of her crit boost in very long content, but would make her better than Titania, where Titania is probably better without Cu Sith. In any case Phantasma doesn't have much access to progressive AoE casters, so if you want/need one of these this is a fairly good card if you missed :card[1314] during Halloween. **Worth considering for Phantasma players needing AoE damage.**

## TL;DR

- :card[383] - **Good for new Phantasma players** who need a melee and can't wait for better options
- :card[614] - **Skip** unless you really want the XP boost
- :card[613] - **Situational pick** for Phantasma AoE needs, especially if you missed Halloween

*A note on recommendations: Play how you like! If you want a card, go for it. My recommendations highlight cards I see as standouts - ones unlikely to be replaced for some time - while being mindful of cost. The game is fairly generous, so you can pick up cards that aren't super strong and still have resources for the next event. Don't hesitate to buy a card you like!*
