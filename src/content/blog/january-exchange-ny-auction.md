I'll keep this one short. The New Year's auction is mostly older cards that have been powercrept quite a bit - this is more of an opportunity for collectors than meta chasers.

## Exchange Card

The more notable pickup this month is the new exchange card :card[1062]. At 145 mochi for the two copies needed to unlock the ability, this is a pretty decent deal to keep in your pocket. 25% damage reduction is a fairly substantial defensive buff and could come in handy if you find content where your team just isn't quite reliable and needs a small defensive boost.

I don't think this is a must have, but if 145 mochi feels cheap to you, it's probably worth grabbing. For newer players this is a nice-to-have, but again, only if 145 feels like mochi you can part with - and that will depend a lot on where you are in your team building.

## Auction Cards

The auction offerings this round are largely powercrept. If you're a collector or nostalgic for older cards, this is your chance to pick them up cheap. For most players focused on team strength, you can safely pass on these.

## TL;DR

- :card[1062] - **Worth considering** if 145 mochi feels affordable - solid defensive option for tricky content
- Auction cards - **Collector's market** - most have been powercrept, pass for meta players

*A note on recommendations: Play how you like! If you want a card, go for it. My recommendations highlight cards I see as standouts - ones unlikely to be replaced for some time - while being mindful of cost. The game is fairly generous, so you can pick up cards that aren't super strong and still have resources for the next event. Don't hesitate to buy a card you like!*
