A Valentine's Day special auction dropped today with some older Valentine's themed cards. These are mostly powercrept, so this is more for collectors than meta chasers. The regular Hunter of Demons auction is now live with some heavy hitters - see below.

## Valentine's Day Special Auction

These cards are available in a limited-time Valentine's auction through February 17th. Most of these are powercrept, so this is mostly a collector's opportunity.

:card[632] is probably the best card of the bunch. She can cap crit rate and give 100% crit damage for the duration plus another 20% crit damage to the whole team, making her a decent fit into a ranged/support slot. She competes with :card[741] that should be coming next month and is better overall, but will probably be much more expensive. Not a bad pickup option for Anima players, but also not worth spending a lot because she probably isn't in your best team, and there are other better options for single target buffers. **Decent Anima support if cheap, but :card[741] is better.**

:card[434] is a decent Phantasma carry if you can get her for cheap, but she competes with :card[725] in the regular auction which is better because her damage reduction affects any targets, not just herself, and :card[740] is coming next month. **Grab :card[725] instead or wait for :card[740] next month.**

:card[567] offers a full team skill damage boost for 4 copies, but her ATK is on the lower side at 11,000. She's also in the standard pool, so she could make a decent reserve if you're looking for skill damage or just want to complete a copy. It's also possible to unlock her lv. 85 and seal if you're planning to use her in reserve. Not bad, but there are lots of good Phantasma reserve options, so hard to justify spending real money on her. **Standard pool - niche reserve option.**

:card[418] is more of a greedy attacker, but she's a bit unreliable given her 50% chance on her damage buff, which could lead to inconsistent clears. She's decent in Endless, and her progressive skill doesn't require multiple copies to unlock, so one copy could be OK if that's something you're really after. But she's nothing special. **Skip unless you want her for Endless.**

:card[435] is alright - 30% damage as leader is fine, but :card[724] is a better card in almost all ways and is coming in a few days in the regular auction, and requires fewer copies to unlock his damage ability. **Pass - :card[724] is better and cheaper.**

:card[426] is powercrept. 9% DR alone just isn't enough to justify a spot on a team, let alone for real cash. **Pass.**

## Auction Cards

The ranking card is :card[723], a top tier assist card. At two copies you get 60% crit damage to your top 2 attackers - a straight upgrade to :card[643]'s 50% crit damage, and like :card[643] this works for any attribute. For 5 copies Divina gets a bonus 10% skill damage per wave. The Divina bonus is nice but not a must have, as Divina has a general lack of skill damage to take advantage of it. He can probably find his way into most lineups especially if you have crit rate or crit rate buffers. Seal it and sell some back once you have the skills you need/want unlocked. **Must buy up to 2 copies for everyone.**

:card[722] is an Anima ATK heavy melee. As a direct upgrade to :card[1413] from exchange, :card[722] is a better deal if you need an Anima attacker, and you might because it's been a while since we have seen many. :card[722] isn't very tanky, and its crit damage final wave bonus is a little lost on it as it has standard melee crit rate which is low, but its 10% Anima crit rate can be a decent bonus if you don't have better options. Probably worth buying for newer players playing Anima that need an attacker but not a long term option, outside maybe some niche use of the crit rate. **Buy if you need an Anima melee and the price is right.**

:card[725] is a very high ATK Phantasma with a damage amp skill, a large skill damage boost, and a strong defensive debuff. She may not be meta but is popular for World Boss as a ranged support for her skill boost and because her slow can pretty significantly reduce the incoming damage, on top of being able to avoid cleanses which some world bosses deploy. She's also an option for newer players looking for their own ranged carry if you didn't pick up :card[1401] or don't want to wait for :card[740] in auction next month. **Worth considering for World Boss damage reduction.**

:card[724] is a strong Divina support melee - one of the strongest Divina melee cards currently in the game. 30% damage as leader and 30% attack speed are good support numbers, and melee is a great place to get those kinds of support buffs. He is HP heavy which gives enough natural EHP to tank for most teams with a strong healer. An additional plus is his abilities aren't type restricted so he can work in multi type teams, though in that role he is probably weaker than :card[549] - but that's only a problem if you have her. I really like this card, and I've been using him in my Divina team for quite some time. A natural comparison is :card[733] which should hit auction next month. :card[733] requires more crit which is harder to find in Divina and is not as tanky, but has an attack skill which is not common in Divina, making these two cards fairly hard to compare - which is better is very team comp dependent. :card[724] is probably more widely strong, where :card[733] might require more focused team building to take advantage of the 50% crit damage leader skill. Non free to play Divina players may want to choose between these two. The risk to both is that a strong new Divina lead could displace either of them. **Strong Divina melee/lead.**

## Exchange & Rerun

:card[477] is the exchange card as predicted. She is not a very strong option - her crit is nice, but her attack is too low for her to be a solid carry, and burn isn't very good for overall damage. **Probably a pass unless she is very cheap.**

The rerun cards were not the Sports Meet cards I expected. Instead we got :card[514] and :card[513].

:card[514] is a top tier card and a staple in world boss rankings. There's a bug where her critical damage buff has no duration, so it lasts until the end of battle. World boss teams use her to cap damage on the highest attacker and time extend to take advantage of the ramped up card. The critical rate duration was also reduced to 4s at some point, and the critical damage is actually 60% not the 80% listed in game data - but even the bugged values make her incredibly strong in world boss. Outside of world boss she's fine as a 3-stat buffer in any format, but in longer battles other elements can compete through progressive buffs, so she isn't a standout in story or towers like she is in world boss. She's going to be extremely expensive. **Must buy for world boss meta chasers.**

:card[513] is nothing too special. He requires :card[510] for full value, and she has been powercrept for Divina, so this doesn't generate a strong combo. **Collectors only.**

- :card[418] - **Skip** unless you want her for Endless
- :card[435] - **Pass** - :card[724] is better and cheaper in a few days
- :card[434] - **Pass** - grab :card[725] instead or wait for :card[740]
- :card[426] - **Pass** - 9% DR is too low to matter

**The Hunter of Demons Auction**:

*A note on recommendations: Play how you like! If you want a card, go for it. My recommendations highlight cards I see as standouts - ones unlikely to be replaced for some time - while being mindful of cost. The game is fairly generous, so you can pick up cards that aren't super strong and still have resources for the next event. Don't hesitate to buy a card you like!*
