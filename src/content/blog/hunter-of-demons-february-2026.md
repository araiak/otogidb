## Auction Cards

The ranking card is :card[723], a top tier assist card. At two copies you get 60% crit damage to your top 2 attackers - a straight upgrade to :card[643]'s 50% crit damage, and like :card[643] this works for any attribute. For 5 copies Divina gets a bonus 10% skill damage per wave. The Divina bonus is nice but not a must have, as Divina has a general lack of skill damage to take advantage of it. He can probably find his way into most lineups especially if you have crit rate or crit rate buffers. Seal it and sell some back once you have the skills you need/want unlocked. **Must buy up to 2 copies for everyone.**

:card[722] is an Anima ATK heavy melee. As a direct upgrade to :card[1413] from exchange, :card[722] is a better deal if you need an Anima attacker, and you might because it's been a while since we have seen many. :card[722] isn't very tanky, and its crit damage final wave bonus is a little lost on it as it has standard melee crit rate which is low, but its 10% Anima crit rate can be a decent bonus if you don't have better options. Probably worth buying for newer players playing Anima that need an attacker but not a long term option, outside maybe some niche use of the crit rate. **Buy if you need an Anima melee and the price is right.**

:card[725] is a very high ATK Phantasma with a damage amp skill, a large skill damage boost, and a strong defensive debuff. She may not be meta but is popular for World Boss as a ranged support for her skill boost and because her slow can pretty significantly reduce the incoming damage, on top of being able to avoid cleanses which some world bosses deploy. She's also an option for newer players looking for their own ranged carry if you didn't pick up :card[1401] or don't want to wait for :card[740] in auction next month. **Worth considering for World Boss damage reduction.**

:card[724] is a strong Divina support melee - one of the strongest Divina melee cards currently in the game. 30% damage as leader and 30% attack speed are good support numbers, and melee is a great place to get those kinds of support buffs. He is HP heavy which gives enough natural EHP to tank for most teams with a strong healer. An additional plus is his abilities aren't type restricted so he can work in multi type teams, though in that role he is probably weaker than :card[549] - but that's only a problem if you have her. I really like this card, and I've been using him in my Divina team for quite some time. A natural comparison is :card[733] which should hit auction next month. :card[733] requires more crit which is harder to find in Divina and is not as tanky, but has an attack skill which is not common in Divina, making these two cards fairly hard to compare - which is better is very team comp dependent. :card[724] is probably more widely strong, where :card[733] might require more focused team building to take advantage of the 50% crit damage leader skill. Non free to play Divina players may want to choose between these two. The risk to both is that a strong new Divina lead could displace either of them. **Strong Divina melee/lead.**

## Predictions

These are more educated guesses and I'll update this section once the auction is released. I'm 99% sure on the above; the below is more like 75%, but they fit some patterns.

I think :card[477] will be the exchange card. She is not a very strong option - her crit is nice, but her attack is too low for her to be a solid carry, and burn isn't very good for overall damage. **Probably a pass unless she is very cheap.**

I think we will see a second rerun of gacha cards from Get Ready! The October Sports Meet at the Tokyo Blue Cemetery! following last month's Alice in the Serious Kingdom gacha re-run. If that is the case, :card[361], :card[362], and :card[363] are all significantly powercrept and are probably not worth considering except for collections.

## TL;DR

- :card[723] - **Must buy** up to 2 copies for everyone - top tier 60% crit damage assist
- :card[722] - **Buy if you need Anima melee** - direct upgrade to :card[1413], not a long term option
- :card[725] - **World Boss option** - ranged support with slow and skill damage boost
- :card[724] - **Strong Divina melee/lead** - one of the best Divina melee, compare with :card[733] next month
- :card[477] (Exchange, predicted) - **Pass** unless very cheap
- :card[361] :card[362] :card[363] (Rerun, predicted) - **Collectors only** - significantly powercrept

*A note on recommendations: Play how you like! If you want a card, go for it. My recommendations highlight cards I see as standouts - ones unlikely to be replaced for some time - while being mindful of cost. The game is fairly generous, so you can pick up cards that aren't super strong and still have resources for the next event. Don't hesitate to buy a card you like!*
