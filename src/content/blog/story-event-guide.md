This is intended as a new(er) player guide to Story events. Unfortunately for very new players, Story events can tend to be very difficult. Don't worry if you get stuck and need to focus on building your team.

In story events you clear chapters to get a single copy of a card, unlocking the card in the exchange. The exchange is on the main event page - cards are purchased with event-specific currency, so spend it all before the event ends! Costs progressively increase for each card copy, which is why story cards are typically more expensive in Auction.

### How Many Copies?

A 5-star card starts at level 70. Each additional copy adds 5 levels (75, 80, 85, 90 at MLB). Check what level an ability unlocks at:
- **Level 70**: 1 copy (just clear the chapter)
- **Level 75**: 2 copies
- **Level 78+**: 3 copies
- **Level 85+**: 4 copies
- **Level 90 (MLB)**: 5 copies

## Story Event Characteristics

Story events are:

- **Multiple rounds**, so nearly all skills and abilities are useful:
  - *Final wave abilities* activate on the last wave of combat (e.g. wave 5 of 5)
  - *Progressive bonuses* say "gain X at the start of a wave" - a 10% boost becomes 10% on wave 1, 20% on wave 2, up to 50% on wave 5
  - *Flat bonuses* are always active
- **Typed** (Divina, Anima, or Phantasma), so there is a -20% to 20% damage bonus depending on the battle type. In most cases this is not important as your strongest team is probably still the best choice.
- **Set SE (Spirit Energy) costs** - SE recharges 1 per 5 minutes, so always use a full team to get the most value.
- **Great for farming XP**, both drop rate bonuses and XP bonuses should be used as much as your team can allow and still clear.

## New Player Tips

### Team Composition

Since you can borrow a strong damage dealer from a friend's helper, focus your own team on survival:

- **1 melee + 2 healers** - Maximum survivability
- **2 melee + 1 healer** - More balanced approach

Prioritize maxing the stats on your tanks and healers so they can protect the borrowed damage dealer long enough to clear.

**Watch the timer!** If you're surviving but timing out, pivot to more damage - boost your borrowed damage dealer with assists, or swap in stronger cards from Auction or events.

**Strong helpers to borrow for damage:** :list[740,709,553,1311,543,630] or similar that synergize with your team. The XP booster :card[1494] is also solid, but works better if you have your own ranged damage dealer to benefit from the crit rate buff.

### Other Tips

- **Do not use revives** unless you're on the chapter boss (last battle of the last section). Chapter bosses are much harder than previous battles - if you can't beat the earlier sections, you probably can't beat the boss either.
- **The exchange can be a great way to farm experience** if you get stuck, or there may be targeted cards in there even at 4-star that can enhance your team.
- **It's ok to hit a wall** and focus on your team.

## Farming Currency

Farm the highest battle you can reliably clear with drop rate boosters! The currency you earn can be spent on card experience in the exchange - this is a fairly efficient way to level up your cards if you need the stats to push through the next chapter.

## Useful Helpers (XP Boosters)

:filter["?type=Healer,Melee,Ranged&rarity=5&ability=EXP+Boost&sort=max_atk&dir=desc"]

Look for these helpers, specifically :card[570] and the new :card[1494] for helpers if you can!

**Note:** These cards stack with each other and themselves!

---

## Useful Assists (XP Boosters)

:filter["?type=Assist&rarity=5&ability=EXP+Boost&sort=id&dir=desc"]

Look for :card[580] - sometimes players will include "Holmes" or "SH" in their name to indicate this on their helper. Same for "Obi" and :card[751]. Both of these cards are also drop rate boosters!

**Note:** These cards stack with each other but not copies of themselves!
