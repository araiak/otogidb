This is intended as a new(er) player guide to Story events. Unfortunately for very new players, Story events can tend to be very difficult. Don't worry if you get stuck and need to focus on building your team.

In story events you clear chapters to get a single copy of a card, unlocking the card in the exchange. Cards are purchased with an event specific currency, there is no reason not to spend all of these before the event ends. Costs progressively increase for each card copy. Because of the cost increases, story cards are typically more expensive in Auction than Tower rewards.

## Tower Event Characteristics

Tower events are:

- **Multiple rounds**, so nearly all skills and abilities are useful. Ability final wave, flat bonus and progressive bonuses are all good.
- **Typed**, so there is a -20% to 20% damage bonus depending on the floor type. In most cases this is not important as your strongest team is probably still the best choice.
- **Great for farming XP**, both drop rate bonuses and XP bonuses should be used as much as your team can allow and still clear.

## New Player Tips

- **Do not use revives** if you are not on a boss floor. Boss floors are much harder than previous floors - if you can't beat the levels before the boss you probably cannot kill the boss.
- **The exchange can be a great way to farm experience** if you get stuck, or there may be targeted cards in there even at 4-star that can enhance your team.
- **It's ok to hit a wall** and focus on your team.

## Farming Currency

| Tier | Floor | Efficiency | Avg Drop | Enemy Lvl | Notes |
|------|-------|------------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Top | 251 | 2.66 | 13.29 | 103 | Best overall |
| Top | 260 | 2.63 | 13.17 | 64 | Good for mid-players |
| Top | 269 | 2.60 | 13.01 | 61 | Good for mid-players |

| Mid | 89/98 | 2.22 | 11.09 | 56-60 | Accessible |

**Summary:** Farm the highest floor you can reliably clear with drop rate boosters!

## Useful Helpers (XP Boosters)

:filter["?type=Healer,Melee,Ranged&rarity=5&ability=EXP+Boost&sort=max_atk&dir=desc"]

Look for these helpers, specifically :card[570] and the new :card[1494] for helpers if you can!

**Note:** These cards stack with each other but not with themselves!

---

## Useful Assists (XP Boosters)

:filter["?type=Assist&rarity=5&ability=EXP+Boost&sort=id&dir=desc"]

Look for :card[580] - sometimes players will include "Holmes" or "SH" in their name to indicate this on their helper. Same for "Obi" and :card[751]. Both of these cards are also drop rate boosters!

**Note:** These cards stack with each other but not with themselves!
