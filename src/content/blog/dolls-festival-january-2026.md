A bit late but here's some notes on this month's cards!

## Story Event

:card[715] has an active event. The card was also buffed from 13% to 28% making it decent for a free card. In practice you are likely to run at least 2 ranged, however your damage tends to be weighted heavily to your strongest card especially as you get buffs with fewer targets, so how well it fares in a team will depend a lot on what other assists you have and your damage balance. It's not a top pick for assist, but it probably can see some play depending on what you need to maximize damage even if you just look at it as 28% damage to your highest ranged attacker - that's not your first choice, but it might be your 6th or 7th depending on what you have available. I would highly recommend new players try to join a guild that can clear level 30 to snag a copy, but it is probably not worth using items for extra copies if you would have to wait 7 months for auction to get the ability anyway. For everyone else, you were probably going to grab a few copies anyway - it is probably worth the 2M contribution to get it uncapped, but it is also not a high priority to do so, so I'd save or go light on pots. **Worth grabbing for new players; veterans can uncap cheaply but don't go hard.**

## Auction Cards

For auction this month should be Dolls Festival, anticipated to start Jan 15th. I'll update this post once the auction comes out if there's anything missed. I think this will be a fairly strong auction.

:card[228] is a bit of a weird card. Anima leaders are dominated by :card[549], but for new players without her, this is a decent starter leader that transitions well into reserve. She's ranged (eating a damage slot) and her skill is basically useless - full AoE with no damage and negligible damage reduction. You're nearly losing a skill slot to field her, and she competes with cards that will hit auction eventually like :card[2186] for that ranged support spot, and personally I'd prefer Il Milione of those choices. That said, 35% damage to 5 targets plus 30% crit damage is strong for a single card when you're building up. Yes, mature Anima teams with :card[514] or :card[741] want to stack buffs on one target rather than spread them - but if you don't have those cards yet, team-wide damage is solid. Once you outgrow her as leader, 30% crit damage in reserve is comparable, but probably slightly weaker in most setups when compared to :card[600]. Whether you actually want crit damage reserves depends on your balance of crit rate, crit damage, and % damage - but it's nice to have the option to transition her rather than bench her entirely. Copies will likely stay in stock since veterans shift her to reserve, so no rush - snag her when you see deals. **Good starter leader for new/intermediate Anima players, decent reserve for everyone else.**

:card[227] is a solid self-sustaining tank with good damage but minimal team support. The main comparison is :card[738], which should hit auction in a few months. :card[738] is the better late-game choice - he lacks self-healing or DR, but has a decent health pool and moderate team buffs, which paired with a good healer is usually enough for most PvE content. :card[227] is the opposite: tankier, hits harder, lives longer, but doesn't help your team much. If you're playing Phantasma and can wait, wait for :card[738]. If you need a tank now and missed :card[1436] or :card[1489], I think she's stronger than both, but there's probably a case to be made for :card[1489]. I personally like her in towers with :card[740] helper - they can duo most content thanks to her self-sustain. **Solid Phantasma tank if you don't have or don't want to wait for Cao Cao.**

:card[751] will probably be in fairly high demand. She's a weaker version of :card[580], however more players have SH and they stack so Obi is probably the better assist to own for friend points. She may end up being fairly expensive, though you can always seal and sell back the copies you needed to unlock abilities to reduce cost with some market risk. XP boosts aren't required outside min/maxing so she's by no means required, but for whales and people who want to min/max XP and item drop rate, she's a must have. **If you're a min/maxer, grab her; otherwise you can pass.**

> **Data Note:** The game data actually has the drop rate boost as 20% not 25% but I don't have the card to validate (and it would be very hard to validate). Just be aware it might be slightly worse than it says for the drop rate, but I don't think that will change anyone's buying decisions.

:card[752] is a weird one. He's in the spirit of :card[741] in being a single target 3 buff card, but they forgot that no one really cares about defensive buffs, so he's a 2 buff card that makes your highest attack target take significantly less damage. That probably would be very good in PvP, but in most of the game your front line is tanking the damage or in world boss you need to play to be able to handle random target damage on your backline. So he just kinda falls short. **I wouldn't recommend him, but if you want him or have a use for him, go for it.**

> **Data Note:** The second skill says crit rate is 40% but game data says 35%. This probably isn't make or break and again I don't have the card to validate, but be aware it might be slightly less crit than described.

## Update: Additional Auction Cards

A few more cards showed up in the auction worth mentioning:

**:card[645]** is essentially a :card[707] for cash instead of a ton of mochi. Since :card[707] is in low stock most of the time, you're looking at 2500 mochi and some time to collect even if you can sell some back. These are both strong greedy attacker bonds. The only real difference is attribute and bond, with Cheshire being Attack instead of Skill bond. These are nice to have 1 or 2 unlocked. **Recommend considering** if the price is right and you don't already have :card[707] unlocked.

**:card[644]** is an XP buffer with a small AoE speed boost. It looks very expensive at the moment and it's not something you need - **probably for collectors**.

**:card[696]** is a decent last round 50% damage boost on an attack bond. This can be nice for newer players, which will probably keep it fairly cheap. % Damage assists aren't actually all that common or that large - notable is :card[1991] but that gets value from the team skill damage. Damage buffs in more mature teams tend to already be stacked fairly high, meaning the marginal damage increase is fairly low. But in newer teams this is a big boost in the last round, which is often when you need it most. **I'd recommend having a copy uncapped for most players** if the price is right.

**:card[267]** is an older exchange demon in fairly low supply. What's notable is the battle time limit, which can be very powerful in world boss. He has low attack and very high HP which might be nice for effective HP in some places. There isn't much special here, but there's probably some niche use for battle time limit in reserve - though it's not likely a top choice. **If you want that in your pocket** and the price is right, go for it!

## TL;DR

- :card[715] - **Worth grabbing** for new players from guild raids; veterans can uncap cheaply but don't go hard
- :card[228] - **Good starter leader** for new Anima players, decent reserve for everyone else
- :card[227] - **Solid Phantasma tank** if you don't have or don't want to wait for :card[738]
- :card[751] - **Must have for min/maxers** who want XP/drop rate boosts; potentially expensive but stacks with :card[580]
- :card[752] - **Pass** unless you have a specific PvP use case
- :card[645] - **Worth considering** - cash alternative to :card[707] if you don't have it unlocked
- :card[696] - **Recommended** for most players - solid last round damage boost, especially for newer teams
- :card[267] - **Niche pickup** - battle time limit for world boss if the price is right
- :card[644] - **Collectors only** - XP buffer, overpriced

*A note on recommendations: Play how you like! If you want a card, go for it. My recommendations highlight cards I see as standouts - ones unlikely to be replaced for some time - while being mindful of cost. The game is fairly generous, so you can pick up cards that aren't super strong and still have resources for the next event. Don't hesitate to buy a card you like!*
