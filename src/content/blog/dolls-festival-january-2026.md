A bit late but here's some notes on this month's cards!

---

## Story Event Assist

:card[715] has an active event. The card was also buffed from 13% to 28% making it decent for a free card. In practice you are likely to run at least 2 ranged, however your damage tends to be weighted heavily to your strongest card especially as you get buffs with fewer targets, so how well it fares in a team will depend a lot on what other assists you have and your damage balance.

It's not a top pick for assist, but it probably can see some play depending on what you need to maximize damage even if you just look at it as 28% damage to your highest ranged attacker - that's not bad.

**Recommendation:** I would highly recommend new players try to join a guild that can clear level 30 to snag a copy, but it is probably not worth using items for extra copies if you would have to wait 7 months for auction to get the ability anyway. For everyone else, you were probably going to grab a few copies anyway - it is probably worth the 2M contribution to get it uncapped, but it is also not a high priority to do so, so I'd save or go light on pots.

## Auction Preview

For auction this month should be Dolls Festival. I'll update this post once the auction comes out if there's anything missed. I think this will be a fairly strong auction.

## Ranking Card

:card[228] is a bit of a weird card. Anima leaders are dominated by :card[549], but for new players without her, this is a decent starter leader that transitions well into reserve.

**The downsides:** She's ranged (eating a damage slot) and her skill is basically useless - full AoE with no damage and negligible damage reduction. You're nearly losing a skill slot to field her, and she competes with cards like :card[2186] for that ranged support spot.

**The upside:** 35% damage to 5 targets plus 30% crit damage is strong for a single card when you're building up. Yes, mature Anima teams with :card[514] or :card[741] want to stack buffs on one target rather than spread them - but if you don't have those cards yet, team-wide damage is solid.

Once you outgrow her as leader, 30% crit damage in reserve is comparable to :card[600]. Whether you actually want crit damage reserves depends on your balance of crit rate, crit damage, and % damage - but it's nice to have the option to transition her rather than bench her entirely.

**Recommendation:** Good leader for new/intermediate Anima players, worth considering for reserve more broadly. Copies will likely stay in stock since veterans shift her to reserve, so no rush - snag her when you see deals.

## Story Exchange Card

:card[227] is a solid self-sustaining tank with good damage but minimal team support.

The main comparison is :card[738], which should hit auction in a few months. :card[738] is the better late-game choice - he's a support-focused tank with solid healing and buffs despite lower survivability. :card[227] is the opposite: tankier, hits harder, lives longer, but doesn't help your team much.

If you're playing Phantasma and can wait, wait for :card[738]. If you need a tank now and missed :card[1436] or :card[1489], she's a straight upgrade over both. I personally like her in towers with :card[740] helper - they can duo most content thanks to her self-sustain.

**Recommendation:** Consider if the price is right and you either already have :card[738] or don't want to wait for her.

## Gacha Cards

### XP Boost Card

:card[751] will probably be in fairly high demand. It is a weaker version of :card[580], however more players have SH and they stack so Obi is probably the better assist to own for friend points. It may end up being fairly expensive and XP boosts aren't required outside min/maxing so it's by no means required, but for whales and people who want to min/max XP and item drop rate, it's a must have.

> **Data Note:** The game data actually has the drop rate boost as 20% not 25% but I don't have the card to validate (and it would be very hard to validate). Just be aware it might be slightly worse than it says for the drop rate, but I don't think that will change anyone's buying decisions.

### Single-Target Buffer

:card[752] is a weird one. It's in the spirit of :card[741] in being a single target 3 buff card, but they forgot that no one really cares about defensive buffs, so it is a 2 buff card that makes your highest attack target take significantly less damage.

That probably would be very good in PvP, but in most of the game your front line is tanking the damage or in world boss you need to play to be able to handle random target damage on your backline. So this one just kinda falls short.

**Recommendation:** I wouldn't recommend it, but if you want it or have a use for it, go for it.

> **Data Note:** The second skill says crit rate is 40% but game data says 35%. This probably isn't make or break and again I don't have the card to validate, but be aware it might be slightly less crit than described.

## TL;DR

- :card[715] - **Worth grabbing** for new players from guild raids; veterans can uncap cheaply but don't go hard
- :card[228] - **Good starter leader** for new Anima players, decent reserve for everyone else
- :card[227] - **Solid Phantasma tank** if you don't have or want to wait for :card[738]
- :card[751] - **Must have for min/maxers** who want XP/drop rate boosts; expensive but stacks with :card[580]
- :card[752] - **Pass** unless you have a specific PvP use case

*A note on recommendations: Play how you like! If you want a card, go for it. My recommendations highlight cards I see as standouts - ones unlikely to be replaced for some time - while being mindful of cost. The game is fairly generous, so you can pick up cards that aren't super strong and still have resources for the next event. Don't hesitate to buy a card you like!*
