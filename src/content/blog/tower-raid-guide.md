This is intended as a new(er) player guide to Tower Raid events. Tower events are very good for new players because you can request help from guild mates - if you find a kind guild, there's a good chance you can get several 5-star cards with help.

In tower events, you get attacked by a raid boss either from doing normal content or by searching for a boss using SE.

## Quick Start Checklist

### Before the Event
1. **Find an active and helpful guild** - this is crucial for getting help on tough floors
2. **Check your friends list** for :card[740] helpers - add Phantasma players if needed (or Anima/Divina carries if you prefer those setups)
3. **Pick your tank** from the lists below (or use whatever tanky card you have)
4. **Fill your reserves** with any damage assists or team buffers you own
5. **If you need a tank**, check auction for one

### During the Event
1. **Run:** borrowed carry + 1 of your tanky cards (3-5 SE)
2. **Survive to timer** → share to guild for help
3. **Wipe?** Don't revive (unless card drop floor)
4. **Hit a wall?** Add more of your own cards or upgrade your tank so you can survive to the timer to share

## Tower Event Characteristics

Tower events are:

- **Multiple rounds**, so nearly all skills and abilities are useful:
  - *Final wave abilities* activate on the last wave of combat
  - *Progressive bonuses* say "gain X at the start of a wave" - these stack up over multiple rounds
  - *Flat bonuses* are always active
- **Untyped**, so use your strongest team regardless of element
- **Variable SE costs** (3-18 SE based on your cards)
- **Continuable** - if you time out, you can continue dealing damage for SE cost +1, or share the boss to your guild for help. For example, if your team costs 18 SE, you can deal the same amount of damage again for 19 SE.
- **XP and drop rate boosts do not help** - save those for Story events!

### SE Cost Calculation

**Important:** Only YOUR cards count toward SE cost. Borrowed friends and reserves are free!

SE cost = sum of stars from your 1-4 cards (min 3, max 18)

- Your 1× 3-star = 3 SE
- Your 1× 5-star = 5 SE
- Your 2× 5-stars = 10 SE
- Borrowed friend's card = free
- Reserve slots = free

This means you can run a powerful borrowed carry alongside a cheap card of your own for very low SE.

## New Player Tips

### Prioritize Survival!

If you survive to the timer, you can share the boss for help or attack again for SE. If you wipe, you have to revive which is expensive.

**Do not revive** outside of critical card drop floors!

**It's ok to hit a wall** and ask for help!

## Low SE Climbing Strategy

Since borrowed helpers are free, the optimal strategy is to borrow a strong damage carry and provide just 1 card of your own. You can push as far as possible with just 1 of your own cards - a 3-star costs only 3 SE, or a 5-star for 5 SE.

**Always fill your reserves!** Reserves don't count toward SE cost, so load them with strong assists and support abilities.

**Note:** The cards below are just examples that most players reasonably have access to - there are plenty of cards that will work! These are just some accessible options to look for.

### Investment Priority

Adding damage is very important for runs with no healer - the faster you clear, the less damage you take. Your priorities should be:

1. **Get a tanky enough tank** - buy enough copies to unlock a key tank ability (level shown below)
2. **Invest in reserves and assists** - damage boosts and DR assists have more impact than upgrading your tank further
3. **Max out your tank last** - MLB is nice but less important than strong reserves

**Mochi optimization tip:** Note the minimum level needed to unlock key abilities. For reserve or assist cards, once abilities are unlocked you can seal them to sell back and recover some of your investment.

### Phantasma Setup (Recommended)

This is the most accessible setup due to :card[740] being widely available as a friend helper and several tanky Phantasma cards being easy to obtain.

**Borrow:** :card[740] - Widely available from friends, has high attack, high skill damage, and its progressive damage boost also affects your card.

**Your card (in priority order):**

1. :card[738] (Lv. 80) - Support abilities boost attack significantly
2. :card[227] (Lv. 70) - Good self-sustain
3. :card[1489] (Lv. 80) - Skill damage synergy with borrowed Shuten, plus self-sustain at low health
4. :card[1436] (Lv. 75) - Tanky recent event card, easy to obtain
5. :card[267] (Lv. 75) - From auction, battle time is helpful for weaker teams, good EHP (note: extra battle time can work against you if trying to survive to share with guild)
6. :card[687] (Lv. 80) - Offensive option from auction, but may need a DR assist or healer sooner

### Divina Setup

The same strategy works for Divina, though tanks lack damage reduction so a DR assist is recommended at higher levels or you may need a healer sooner.

**Borrow:** :card[1311], :card[739], or :card[553]

**Your card (in priority order):**

1. :card[542] (Lv. 80) - From auction, higher EHP
2. :card[358] (Lv. 70) - Older so less stock in auction, but good EHP
3. :card[593] (Lv. 70) - From auction
4. :card[6] (Lv. 70) - Fairly weak, but all players are given a copy from story mode

### Anima Setup

Anima has fewer accessible options and carries aren't as common in friend lists - you may need to target add Anima players.

**Borrow:** :card[674], :card[630], :card[543], or :card[514]

**Your card (in priority order):**

1. :card[586] (Lv. 75) - From auction but old/low stock
2. :card[722] (Lv. 70) - Event from 6 months ago, not very tanky so may need a DR assist
3. :card[670] (Lv. 75) - Extremely high EHP 4-star from auction, but low damage contribution

### Assists for Your Reserves

Since reserves are free, maximize their value:

- :card[664] (Lv. 85) - 2-card damage boost
- :card[618] (Lv. 85) - Weaker damage option than :card[664]
- :card[723] (Lv. 75) - Multi-target damage
- :card[643] (Lv. 75) - Multi-target damage
- :card[656] (Lv. 75+) - Anima only damage boost
- :card[688] (Lv. 70+) - Balanced damage/defense for a melee with an attack skill

Any multi-target damage boosts work. Even single-target assists that only buff your carry are fine.

**Crit damage boosts** are especially powerful if you have :card[1307] or :card[1494] in reserves.

**Damage reduction (DR) assists** help your tank survive at higher levels. Examples: :card[1062], :card[688], :card[1437], :card[749], :card[657], :card[677]

### Reserve Monsters (Non-Assists)

Strong reserve monsters from auction are very expensive, but some options include:
- :card[642] (Lv. 90) - Only really effective at MLB
- :card[672] (Lv. 90) - Only effective at MLB
- :card[228] (Lv. 75) - Anima only

Most of your reserves probably won't come from auction, so check what you have available that benefits the team. Some standard gacha cards to look for:

- :card[2373] (Lv. 75) - Phantasma only
- :card[2191] (Lv. 75) - Anima only
- :card[1321] (Lv. 75+) - Divina
- :card[744] (Lv. 85) - Any type, 15% damage per round is huge! Usable in all multi-round content (tower raid, story) as a reserve, but not single-round. Worth PvP orbing if you can hit 85 (not beneficial before that) - otherwise save orbs for single-round content like World Boss or PvP
- :card[661] (Lv. 85) - Any type
- :card[600] (Lv. 77) - 4-star but might be worth PvP orbing, 40% crit damage is a big boost

You can find a full list of monsters with team-wide abilities by using the filter "team" on the card list and cross-checking against your collection.

## Scaling Up Your Team

Once you hit a wall, progressively add your own cards to the team. You always have 1 borrowed friend, then your SE cost is the sum of stars from your 1-4 cards (min 3, max 18).

**Your second card should probably be a healer** - this helps you survive to the timer so you can share with your guild for help.

For example:
- Your 1× 5-star + friend = 5 SE
- Your 1× 5-star + 1× 3-star healer + friend = 8 SE
- Your 4× 5-stars + friend = 18 SE (max)

Once you're running 3 of your own cards, the 4th card is relatively cheap to add - going from 15 SE to 18 SE is only +3 for another 5-star, so you might as well use your strongest full team.

**Keep in mind:** Card drop floors often jump to 2x the HP and then drop back down. You'll need to assess your survivability and add a healer eventually, or add more damage progressively.

### How Much to Min/Max?

You can decide how much you want to min/max SE costs, but for most players it's easiest to start with your 1 best 5-star rather than trying to see exactly how far you can survive with only a 3-star or 4-star card. Then adjust based on what challenges you run into.
