We just got ranking data but not tower data for Evil Gods Attack. Note: any of these could change or be re-arranged before the event starts. For general tower raid tips, check out the [Tower Raid Guide](/blog/tower-raid-guide).

## Tower Drop

:card[1398] isn't confirmed but it's the only one without a source set, and that would be no surprise. She is a Divina melee card and it's been a while since we've gotten one from an event. She's similar to :card[1489] but trades damage reduction for a self damage boost for a single copy. The skill damage is also a bit lower. I think :card[1489] is probably better as a melee, but if :card[1398] is tanky enough on its own she should be fine in most content with a strong healer. It should be fairly easy to get and you can get help from your guild, so there's no reason not to grab at least one and have something to start a Divina team. **Easy pickup for new players.**

---

## Half Ranking

:card[1399] has me scratching my head a bit - Divina ranged with HP boost and Skill damage boost, but an AoE skill with fairly low damage. The bonuses also are not progressive, so I don't think there's much here. This probably won't be such a bloody event, so I wouldn't recommend spending a lot of resources on her, but you might be able to grab a cheap copy in the first half. **Low priority - grab cheaply if you can.**

---

## Overall Ranking

:card[1402] is also a head scratcher. I think a lot of people probably thought :card[1401] was the ranking (and it could change before the event starts), which would be a powerhouse better than even :card[1311] as far as ranking rewards - although Divina needed :card[1311] badly!

:card[1402] is also a Divina ranged with :card[1435] passive and a single-target :card[1437] slow. This is strictly better than :card[1435] but he was also nothing special. She will probably have some niche use for Divina in endless since 50% slow can be very nice to avoid double crits ending your run, but AoE slow would have been better for that purpose. In any case, Divina still needs standard banner HP buffers to really be viable in endless. **Probably not a super bloody event - don't go hard, but worth grabbing if you're near the cutoffs.**

## Gacha

Second half gacha is going to bleed everyone of their invokers and mochi.

:card[1444] is a new powerhouse with 75% skill and 75% crit damage. Highly recommended for most players if you have the resources - invoker one and mochi one for at least the crit damage, which is great on a carry you own. Do note the once per team restriction, so you can try to borrow one if you don't get it. But even if you don't plan to use it, I'd try to mochi one because that is guaranteed to sell on auction later if she doesn't get power crept. **Highly recommended - invoker + mochi if you can.**

:card[1401] is a very strong greedy attacker. Her downside silence is only 5s, and outside of that she has :card[740] skill and attack power, but her self buffs of 30% crit and 60% crit damage make her way stronger as your carry. Even if you have :card[740], a team with both cards - :card[1401] as the greedy carry and :card[740] as your support carry - is going to be crazy strong! With her natural crit of 52%, you can hit 77% with :card[734] or even 97% with :card[1319]. I don't know if she's game breaking, but she's going to be very strong. **Strong pickup for Phantasma teams.**

### Standard Gacha Additions

These next few look to join the standard gacha:

:card[1443] - although her banner guarantee has passed, I'll note her here since she's a pretty strong assist. I like this card a lot. It gives you the :card[740] progressive effect for Divina, which was needed, but it does it as an assist. Instead of sacrificing an ability on a very high attack card that is likely sucking up all your one or two target buffs, you can put it on a tank or healer that is already there for support and have it buff the whole team. She joins the standard banner so if you missed out you aren't totally out of luck. With the strong gacha cards coming up with this event in :card[1444] and :card[1401], you're going to need those invokers anyway - and who knows, with the 3x drop rate through the event you still might be able to get your hands on all of them! **Strong Divina assist - worth grabbing if you can.**

:card[1442] is interesting as well, but maybe less so. She trades a good skill for higher innate crit rate and an interesting leader skill. 50% crit damage is strong, especially in Phantasma where you can hit high crit rate pretty easily, although you lose access to :card[734]. The trade-offs make her a harder sell. There's no exchange option listed and you're surely out of invokers from the last two cards, so I can't really recommend it even though I want to try and make her work in my Phantasma lineup since I don't have the benefit of a leader skill myself. More likely I'll have to go in on the :card[734] auction in March which might be relatively expensive, but melee is an easier slot for leader skills in my opinion. **Hard to recommend given resource constraints.**

:card[1445] is an interesting replacement for :card[583] in Anima endless lineups, replacing two cards with one. Note: the card data says Divina, but that is probably an error and will likely be fixed. It might be worth grabbing a copy during the guarantee if you're set on trying to finish an Anima endless team, but otherwise joining the standard gacha this one probably won't be a great priority. **Niche pickup for Anima endless builds.**

## Feb Exchange

:card[1413] joins the exchange for Feb. A bit of an offensive Anima melee card, she shares the same passive as :card[722] which should be hitting auction in Feb as well. :card[722] is just better in all ways and shouldn't be too crazy expensive, so maybe this one is for collectors or players who can't wait till the 15th. **Wait for :card[722] in auction instead.**

---

## TL;DR

- :card[1398] (Tower) - **Easy pickup** for new players starting Divina
- :card[1399] (Half Ranking) - **Low priority** - grab cheaply if you can
- :card[1402] (Overall Ranking) - **Don't go hard** - niche endless use, grab if near cutoffs
- :card[1444] (Gacha) - **Highly recommended** - invoker + mochi if you have resources
- :card[1401] (Gacha) - **Strong pickup** - excellent for Phantasma
- :card[1443] (Standard Gacha) - **Strong Divina assist** - worth grabbing if you can
- :card[1442] (Standard Gacha) - **Hard to recommend** - interesting but resource-constrained
- :card[1445] (Standard Gacha) - **Niche** - Anima endless only
- :card[1413] (Feb Exchange) - **Pass** - wait for :card[722] in auction

*A note on recommendations: Play how you like! If you want a card, go for it. My recommendations highlight cards I see as standouts - ones unlikely to be replaced for some time - while being mindful of cost. The game is fairly generous, so you can pick up cards that aren't super strong and still have resources for the next event. Don't hesitate to buy a card you like!*
