I wanted to do a quick rundown of the O Holy Night story event now that we have full card information. For general story event tips, check out the [Story Event Guide](/blog/story-event-guide).

## Limited Time: Half-Price 5-Star Orb

There's a **5-star bonus orb available at half price** until the event ends! Given the weaker rewards in this event, it's highly recommended that players who can [PVP farm](/blog/pvp-farming-guide) make an effort to grab this extra orb before time runs out.

## New Player Priority

**Aim for Chapter 4!** I think :card[1436] is the standout card for new players in this event - a solid tank, much tankier than last event's :card[1489]. If you already have strong melee units, you can skip. Later on she'll likely be replaced by units with better support skills (e.g. :card[738] has less EHP but offers more team value with good healers). If you can't reach the Chapter 4 boss, I'd recommend saving your resources (revives, items) rather than spending them on earlier chapters.

### Rating System

| Rating | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ***** | Very good for new players |
| **** | Situational or may be replaced by other cards fairly easily |
| *** | Ok fallback if you have extra resources or need it to progress |
| * - ** | Probably not worth buying |

## Story Rewards

| Card | Chapter Reward | New Player Ranking | Comment |
|------|----------------|-------------------|---------|
| :card[1995] | 1 | ** | For 2 copies this helps make a melee front liner more tanky if you need that, if you don't easy skip |
| :card[1433] | 2 | * | Her skill is pretty underwhelming, probably a skip for everyone |
| :card[1431] | 3 | * | Skill is bad and her ability is too weak for 3 copies |
| :card[1436] | 4 | ***** | For new players struggling with tankiness this is a pretty good card 25% Damage Reduction (Self) for 2 copies is pretty great, the skill adds to the tankiness, but would be preferred to be targeting the highest attack rather than itself! |
| :card[1435] | 5 | **** | This is a slightly weaker Divina version of :card[1312] or :card[658] (wave clearers with progressive skill damage). If you're looking for multi-target damage that scales over rounds, there aren't many other available options. |
| :card[30015] | N/A | *** | Leveling up your monsters is not a bad choice if none of the cards really hit a need for your team, or if you get stuck to level up and try to push the next chapter, don't feel bad if you need to take some level up cards! |

## Ranking Rewards

:card[1439] is a ranking reward and uh... yeah nothing really comes together here, tanky damage leeching ranged... maybe freeze could be something, but if you wanted freeze its likely other freeze cards that are just straight up better would be coming through the Christmas Auction (assuming there is one, see :card[383]).

:card[1438] is the overall ranking reward, and is quite good. Big progressive boost and a little defensive help with a high single-target damage skill that debuffs enemies to take more damage. She's not game breaking, but she's pretty good. I wrote my last info assuming she required 5 copies from gacha, but if you're ranking fairly high (top 200-300), she's a lot better than I originally thought.

## Gacha Cards

**New players: skip these.** The copies required to unlock useful abilities aren't worth the pulls.

:card[1437] is still good for a defensive assist.

:card[1992] is still fine, but there are other alternatives. I rated her assuming she was a ranking reward, being a gacha card drops her down a bit, since :card[655] is also dirt cheap although she's more single target than team buffing, but at 5 copies for the team buff big pass from me.

---

## TL;DR

**New players:** Grab :card[1436] from Chapter 4 if you need a tank, skip the rest unless you have spare currency.

*A note on recommendations: Play how you like! If you want a card, go for it. My recommendations highlight cards I see as standouts for newer players - ones that will help you progress. The game is fairly generous, so you can pick up cards that aren't super strong and still have resources for the next event. Don't hesitate to buy a card you like!*
