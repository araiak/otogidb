Today I ran into a few newer players with an incorrect PvP setup, so I thought I'd write a quick guide. Many years ago there were many groups and guides for this, but now a lot of that information is lost and fragmented. I wanted to capture my understanding of PvP farming based on my and my guild's experiences, so maybe more players can standardize their PvP farming and improve the overall experience.

There are other setups that work for PvP farming, but this guide covers what I know works consistently. Most PvP farmers I come across use these setups or similar ones that qualify as "Awful" difficulty.

## TL;DR - Quick Setup

**Attack Team:** Just :card[75] at level 70 (or :card[28] as alternate) - no reserves/assists/bonds

**Defense Team:** Just 1 healer (no reserves/assists/bonds), level 70, abilities NOT unlocked:
:list[102,118,634]

**Find farming partners** by looking for players with names like "awful" or "pvp on" - and consider naming yourself similarly (sounds silly but it really helps).

**Test new targets** with a single challenge first before using 3x!

**Avoid Auto mode** - it's risky and you may lose battles. See [How to Play](#how-to-play) for manual tips.

## How It Works

The idea is pretty simple: with a single strong 3-star burst damage dealer, you can beat a weak 5-star healer. The game registers this as a very challenging battle due to the star disparity, netting **20 points per challenge** or **60 for the 3x challenge**.

Between events, players have several choices for how to spend SE (Spirit Energy - the game's stamina, regenerates 1 per 5 minutes): farming PvP for orbs, farming mochi, or farming XP. Farming XP is also a compelling choice, but for F2P or lower spenders, using your monthly invokers to cherry pick great cards and then PvP farming to MLB them is a solid approach.

Many players participate and can often be identified by names including things like "awful" or "pvp on". If you follow this strategy, I recommend naming yourself similarly and trying to trade with players who are farming you back as much as possible.

I'd also recommend generally targeting higher level players. Lower level players are still constrained by soul stones, and over-farming them could become an issue. Higher level players are probably sitting on a heap and won't really care - 3K soul stones isn't a lot to them, but to newer players it can be a bit annoying.

Some players farm at level 60 instead of 70. These players may show as "pvp on" but appear as "Deadly" rather than "Awful". This guide covers level 70 farming only - I'm not familiar with the common level 60 setups.

## The Math

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| 5-star orb cost | 4,000 challenge points |
| Monthly limit | 2 orbs (refreshes on 15th) |
| Total needed | 8,000 challenge points |
| Points per 3x challenge | 60 points |
| SE per 3x challenge | 30 SE |
| **Total SE needed** | **4,000 SE** |

**Daily SE income:**
- Natural regeneration: 288 SE
- Challenge mode (3 runs): ~97 SE
- **Total:** ~385 SE/day

So you need roughly **10.4 days** to get 2 orbs, which is pretty reasonable with normally 2 weeks between events.

## Attack Team Setup

Your attack team should be **just 1 burst damage dealer** - no reserves, no assists, no bonds.

:team["req=75"]

:card[75] is the preferred attacker because she has high attack power for a 3-star card and a high-damage single-target skill - exactly what you need to burst down a healer. She can be farmed fairly easily in Daily Dungeon on Tuesday for players looking to get started.

**Level:** 70

### Alternate Option

:team["req=28"]

:card[28] at level 70 also works, but she has lower attack than Tokarev so she's slightly riskier.

---

## Defense Team Setup

Your defense team should be **just 1 healer** - no reserves, no assists, no bonds. This ensures attackers can reliably beat your team.

Your healer should ideally be **level 70 with abilities NOT unlocked**. Unlocked abilities can increase offensive or defensive strength (healing over time, increased defense, attack buffs that improve heal rate, etc.), which makes it risky for attackers. If you already have a card with abilities unlocked but they're minor or not relevant, you can use "Seal" in the upgrade menu to split the card and get one back at level 70.

Most 5-stars with low stats and no/low self-heal work. I'd avoid cards with high stats (typically newer cards), crit buffs, stuns, and/or large healing abilities.

### Easy Targets (Recommended)

:list[102,118,634]

These cards deal damage without buffs, so they don't require any extra damage from the attacker.

:card[102] will show as "Awful" at level 61, which is very easy. At level 70 the random speed down ability may bump her to medium difficulty.

:card[634] is available on auction and generally pretty cheap. Keep her uncapped for safety - she's perfect due to low stats and an irrelevant skill.

### Medium Difficulty

:list[167,230,583,641]

:card[583] may not be a good long-term choice if you want to do challenge mode, since uncapping her will make her harder to farm.

### Harder (RNG Dependent)

:list[337]

Because of her stun, :card[337] can be a bit RNG-dependent. Auto has a moderate risk of failure.

### 4-Star Options

:list[474,675]

:card[474] works well at level 80 as a healer and can potentially be found on auction.

:card[675] works up to level 85, but becomes fairly difficult at that level.

## How to Play

**Important:** For new targets, test with a single challenge first so you don't waste 30 SE on 9 points!

Auto can be a bit risky for this mode and you may lose some battles. If you're okay with that, it's not going to add a significant amount of time overall. Most of your progress whittling down the healer comes from skills, especially crits. A lot of the RNG comes from crits - both critical heals and skill criticals.

### Pooling Ability Points

The way to maximize damage is to **hold off and pool ability points**.

This approach:
- May force the healer to attack instead of healing, meaning they aren't slowing your progress while you're pooling damage
- Reduces the risk of progress being reversed by crits or abilities from the healer
- Builds up your combo bonus for higher damage when you burst

### Animation Canceling

After you have most of your ability points filled up, you want to start weaving skills in. Your skill animation can cancel your attack animation, so you can use this to your advantage:

1. Wait for your bullet to be in flight
2. Hit your skill
3. Wait for another bullet to fire
4. Hit your next skill

By doing this you ensure you aren't delaying normal attack damage because of your skill animations. If this all goes well, even with fairly bad RNG you should finish the healer off at the last second.

Give it a try and enjoy your MLB daemons!
