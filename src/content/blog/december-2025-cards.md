Christmas cards and the December auctions are live, so I wanted to give some personal notes on these cards. I won't cover every card here, just the more relevant or eye-catching ones - full card info is available on the [Cards](/) and [Updates](/updates) pages.

## About Me

First, since this is one of my first posts, I'll give some background on myself as a player that will give some context on the inputs I have. I played the original AGG back when that was live and eventually quit. Around 8 months ago I came across Otogi as a kind of re-hash of AGG that was re-running and joined up, the first few events I participated in are now coming up on auction.

I've ranked top 80 overall in some recent events, and am hovering around world boss 200 on rankings although I'm not building for or putting much effort into world boss rankings. So I have a fairly strong team, but I'm not at the cutting edge of the "meta". In any case I want to share my thoughts on some of these cards.

## Christmas Cards

:card[1991] is the first released card into the standard pool. This is a fairly strong Divina assist card, however Divina assists are fairly crowded with :card[689] which is currently on auction, or :card[723] which should be coming to permanent auction in several patches. It may not be the best option, but it is a good option and uncapping will net you duplicates on unseal that could be used on your whole team if you don't have better options. The main problem is top players probably don't need it, and newer players probably shouldn't waste pulls because it requires too many copies to be useful, and there are good assists on auction like :card[664].

:card[1435] is essentially a Divina version of :card[1312]'s skill (hitting 3 enemies with highest ATK) that increases in damage round over round. It looks like it's balanced to be a story card, so it may be accessible to newer players, and only requires 3 copies to get the skill which is... fine, I guess.

:card[1437] might be the best card of the bunch with very strong defensive value. That might help teams drop from 2 to 1 healers in some situations and enable higher overall damage. The ATK speed debuff is comparable to :card[690] and :card[725], and could allow teams that rely on those cards for indirect damage reduction to swap in a stronger offensive card and use this assist instead. This is very likely to be a gacha card so I'm guessing value only starts at 2 copies which is 70 pulls and 250 mochi, so this is a reasonable cost if you need tankiness very badly, and might be one of the more popular cards in the set.

:card[1438] is another interesting card. Melee are generally not very popular, but it has a strong skill, and self buff over time like :card[628] with built-in defensive ability could make this card useful to players for endless. But it probably requires too many copies to be interesting to most players, and is probably not strong enough to orb. Even its damage down requires 3 copies, which is just too many.

:card[1992] looks like maybe a ranking card and is an ok Phantasma healer. The skill is ok, but I think 1-target crit rate like :card[655] is generally less favorable than 2+ target crit rate since 2-target buffs like :card[664], :card[723] (Lv. 72 ability), and :card[643] all enable and encourage moving from one carry to two in a lot of content. The MLB ability is decent, you could argue it's better than :card[2373] but in practice most of your damage is coming from crits from one or two carries. The card might be more accessible but at 5 copies to unlock the ability most players might be waiting for auction.

## Auction Cards

:card[689] is one of the strongest assists out there. In longer content this is comparable to :card[707], but the MLB bonus in short content like World Boss or boss phases in Tower/Story generally makes this card better for Divina teams. You can also potentially MLB and then seal and sell back copies so if you are floating a bunch of jewels you can potentially get this one for fairly cheap, especially if you already snagged one or more copies when the Gacha was live. At MLB, :card[723] is slightly better for Divina teams since its MLB skill is Divina-only, but weaker in all other situations. Since Toyouke-Omikami is in limited supply and likely going for close to 500 mochi each, Okita is still a decent alternative for players who don't have it. **Must buy for paying Divina players**, a skip for everyone else.

:card[690] is a strong Anima melee whose MLB seems very strong for World Boss and has a good skill, but I don't think it's a must have. It's a nice one, but it's running 2000 jewels at the moment which is probably just too much for a melee world bosser. **Strong pass for most.**

:card[664] is a permanent add and probably a **must buy for pretty much everyone**. The upfront cost is fairly high, but you can seal and sell back copies after the fact which will nearly make any reserve or support a :card[672] for the cost of a few hundred mochi.

:card[688] was the ranking card from the event but its usefulness is... questionable? I'm sure there is use for it, maybe for a melee wave clearer where a little tankiness and skill damage could be useful, making the card work like :card[593] or the much stronger :card[734], or doubling down on one of those cards to make a super AoE skill nuker. But I think those assist slots are probably better used for support cards that increase damage of your carries directly like :card[664], :card[643], or more widely like :card[618] which are all fairly accessible on auction. **Pass unless you have a lot of mochi floating around.**
